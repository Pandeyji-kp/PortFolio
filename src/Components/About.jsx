          Hello! I'm Karan Pandey, a passionate Front-End Developer specializing in creating interactive, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. Currently pursuing my B.Com from IGNOU, I bring a unique combination of business insight and technical expertise to every project.<br />

          With hands-on experience in the MERN stack, I've worked on a variety of projects—from e-commerce platforms to real-time chat applications—focusing on building modern, scalable user interfaces with React and Tailwind CSS. I love turning complex ideas into smooth, intuitive designs that users can enjoy.<br />

          I'm constantly exploring new technologies, improving my development skills, and focusing on delivering high-quality, responsive websites that meet both user and business needs.
